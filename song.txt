Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like
getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)

Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with cuffs and not strings

My wrist, stop watchin',
my neck is flossin'
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)
